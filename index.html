    <p><strong>The World Wide Web (WWW)</strong></a>, commonly known as the Web,
    is an <strong>information system where documents and other web resources are identified by <u>Uniform Resource Locators</u></strong> (URLs, such as https://example.com/),
     which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.</p>
    <p>The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP),
       may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser,
     and are published by a software application called a web server.</p>

   </p><p style="margin-top :40px;">The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet,
     which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon which technologies the Web is built.
