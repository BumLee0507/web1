  target="_blank" title= "css란 무엇인가 (네이버블로그)"> <strong>Style Sheets (CSS)</strong></a> is a <u><strong>style sheet</u> language</strong> used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.<p>[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>[2]

CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
including layout, colors, and fonts.<p>[3] This separation can improve content accessibility,
provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .
css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .
css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
